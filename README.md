## Hello! P.K. here!

I am:  
- an Electrical and Electronics Engineer by qualification  
- a Software Engineer by profession  
- working as a production supervisor and debugger  
- and have interests spanning from Philosophy and Mathematics to Computer Science and Biology  
  
Here are some of my favorite repositories:
- [**LitCode**](https://github.com/prankapo/litcode): A literate programming tool written in Python which
  allows the user to choose a markup language of their choice when writing literate programs.  
- [**Remote Controlled Rover**](https://github.com/prankapo/Remote-Controlled-Rover): A remote controlled
  rover I built from ground up using RPi 3B+, ATmega328p and lots of hardboard and PVC pipes. I even wrote a
  paper on it with my friends!!  
- [**CrazyOS Classic**](https://github.com/prankapo/CrazyOS-Classic): A toy operating system written in 8086
  assembly language. It is not even an operating system: it is essentially a sick cousin of MS-DOS and can run
  programs, tell you time and date, let you edit files, etc. using a very complex command-line interface. It
  is sick, but it is my baby and like all good parents, I take responsibility for it and love it.  
- [**VCERS-DEP**](https://github.com/prankapo/VCRS-DEP): A complicated name for a really simple thing! This
  program just extracts data collected by CRS onboard Voyager 1 and 2's and publicly availble at [NASA's Space
  Physics Data Facility](https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/voyager/). This project was nothing special, just
  an exercise in Python.  
- [**PESMO**](https://github.com/prankapo/PESMO): I do have abbreviations for simple things. PESMO stands for
  _Poor Engineering Student's Modular Oscilloscope_. Nothing special: It just uses the ADC on ATmega328P to
  read signals upto at least &plusmn;10V (it will most likely blow your microcontroller and force you to buy a
  real oscilloscope. You will thank me for it).  

and yes, a [**sandbox**](https://github.com/prankapo/sandbox), where every weird thing I work on goes. Parts
of sandbox which I think might be helpful for others will be made public.  

Don't hesitate to check out the repos under my name and be not afraid to play with them! Feel free to contact
me by mail (kapoorpraneet2619@gmail.com) regarding them.
